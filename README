Developing
----------
An Xcode project file is included, that should let you develop libMEI.

We use googletest for unit testing.

To create new files: 
	- Go to File -> New File -> C and C++ -> C++ File
	- Ensure the checkbox for creaing a .h file is selected
	- Choose file location to be in the src folder
	- Once created, add the header file to Targets -> libmei -> Copy Headers
	- Right-click on the header file, choose "Set Role" and set it to "Public"

For every src <file>.cpp/h you create, create a test/<file>_test.cpp
	- For _test files, no header files are needed. When creating the file uncheck the box 		that also creates a .h file
